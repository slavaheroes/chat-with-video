Ensure that:
1. Questions are clear and can be answered using only the information in the given chunk
2. Answers are concise and directly related to the questions

Provide the output in parsable JSON without using code blocks:
[
  {{"question": "question1", "answer": "answer1"}},
  {{"question": "question2", "answer": "answer2"}},
  {{"question": "question3", "answer": "answer3"}}
]
